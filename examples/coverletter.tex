%\lettersection{About Me}
With over 9 years of experience building and maintaining large-scale backend systems for payment platforms, I'm excited to apply for the Software Java Engineer position at Adyen. Adyen's focus on diversity and its innovative approach to financial technology align perfectly with my values and career goals. My experience in both cloud and on-premises environments would be a valuable asset to your team.

%\lettersection{Why Google?}
Throughout my career, I've tackled complex technical challenges, including optimizing backend systems for efficient operation. In my current role at EVBox, I managed systems handling over 12 million charging station transactions annually. Here, I leveraged Spring Boot, microservices architecture, and my experience with various infrastructure setups to streamline processes and improve performance.

My ability to integrate with external APIs is proven by my work at Mobiquity, where I developed REST APIs used by multiple banks. My strong foundation in SQL databases, including PostgreSQL, ensures I can effectively contribute to Adyen's robust payments infrastructure.

Beyond technical skills, I'm passionate about automation and building strong team collaboration. At Mobiquity, I led the automation of bank onboarding, which significantly boosted efficiency. I actively seek different viewpoints to find the best solutions and ensure high-quality code through careful attention to detail.

%\lettersection{Why Me?}
Adyen's mission of empowering businesses with innovative payment solutions is incredibly motivating. The chance to contribute to a platform trusted by global leaders aligns with my desire to work on impactful projects.
My resume provides further details about my qualifications. I'm eager to discuss how I can leverage my skills and experience to benefit Adyen. Thank you for your time and consideration.
